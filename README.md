# HTMLandCSSReflections
This project is for the purpose of the recreation of the https://www.netmatters.co.uk website with partial functionality
This is meant to demonstrate my ability to use SCSS and CSS to style and structure and animate basic elements of a website. 


This project has undergone several revisions and will need more in the future to fix several smaller bugs i've noticed appearing during the later stages.
